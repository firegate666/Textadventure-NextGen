There are a few rules that should be honored when developing

1) Everything checked in into branch master will be checked by jenkins ci who pushes to branch latest_stable

2) Deployment only through branch latest_stable

3) Everything pushed is working

4) Before pushing, use "ant quickcheck" to test your code. It executes
	# PHP, JS and CSS Syntaxcheck
	# PHP Code Style
	# PHP Copy Paste Detection
	# PHPUnit

5) If a bigger feature is developed by several parties or has to be pushed in between, switch to a feature branch
